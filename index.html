    <h1>1. Difference between flex-direction as row and column.</h1>
    <p>This is a CSS property based on the concept of the flexbox. Flex-direction property can be applied to the parent elements and then the child elements of this parent tag will be placed accordingly.</p>
    <p>The difference is when we apply flex-direction : row, child elements will be placed one after another in the same row (horizontally) and then the row or x-axis will be considered as the main axis, in this case the y-axis will be known as cross axis. </p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>


    <div class="container">
        <div class="flex1-items"></div>
        <div class="flex1-items"></div>
        <div class="flex1-items"></div>
    </div>
    
    <p>On the other hand if we apply flex-direction : column places the child elements in column(vertically) means every child element will be placed one after another in the same column, and then the y-axis will be considered as the main axis and x-axis will be known as cross axis.
    </p>
