    <h1>6. What is z-index in CSS?</h1>
    <p>The z-index property determines the stack level of an HTML element. The “stack level” refers to the element’s position on the Z axis (as opposed to the X axis or Y axis). Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. If the z-index value of any element is positive then that element will be at the top and element having negative value of z-index will be at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>Note :-  z-index will only work on an element whose position property has been set to absolute, relative and fixed.
